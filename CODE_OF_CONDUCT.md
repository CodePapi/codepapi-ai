# Be Nice

This is a hobby project. Just be respectful to other people:

- Be kind and helpful
- No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- No spam or self-promotion
- Have fun, it's just code!

If someone's being a jerk, let us know. Otherwise, just enjoy building stuff together.
### Reporting Issues

If something's not cool, just let me know. You can:
- Open an issue
- Message me directly
- Email if you prefer privacy

No formal process, just honest feedback.
